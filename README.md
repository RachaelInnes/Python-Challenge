# Python-Challenge
Module 2.0 Challenge
PyBank
For this challenge I utilised some of the solution codes that we used during the classes (using dictionaries and also the Employee Data)
I did use Chatgpt when trying to have the script also write to a txt file, I found this part particularly difficult, as it wasn't something we had covered, we had to a csv file but not a text. This took me some time. 
Thankyou.
